## Required packages
* LinearAlgebra
* Printf
* DelimitedFiles
* JuMP
* Mosek
* MosekTools



## Data
All datasets are in the zip `data.zip`.

### MATPOWER data with more than 1000 buses
There are two files per instance:
* A ".mat" file with all quadratic terms (and possibly a constant for the objective function)
* A ".ctr" file that indicates the type of each constraint along with its lhs and rhs
NB : OPF problems with thermal limits in current, linear objective function and aggregation of generators associated to the same bus
* the files ".m" useful to reconstruct decompositions

### Clique decompositions
There are 15 clique decompositions in this repertory (10 decompositions used for linear regression and 5 obtained with our clique merging strategy). One clique decomposition is defined by two files:
* A block file
* A clique tree file

### Log files
There are 15 different log files for each instance:
* The ones used for the linear regression (10 decompositions)
* The ones obtained with our decomposition

### Linear regression parameters
There are the linear regression parameters used to generate our clique decomposition (1 file per instance).

## Functions

### To generate clique decompositions
```julia
write_file_decompositions(data_path, instances, algo, repo_name, FUSION, fusion_type = "", size_max_IPmerging=0, nb_times=0, kmax=0)
```
The function `write_file_decompositions` generates clique decompositions for instances in `instances` in repository `..\\data\\decompositions` following algorithm `algo` ("MD" (Minimum Degree), "cholesky", "cholesky_real") and clique merging algorithm `fusion_type` ("IP" (Integer Programming), "Molzahn", "our_merging_heuristic") if `FUSION="YES"`. The parameters `size_max_IPmerging` and `nb_times` are useful for the clique merging "IP": `size_max_IPmerging` is the clique size that we do not want to exceed and `nb_times` is the number of times that we want to apply the clique merging algorithm. The parameter `kmax` is useful for the clique merging "our_merging_heuristic" and indicates the number of iterations after which the criterion is changed. The argument `data_path` points the repertory which contains OPF instances. The argument `repo_name` is used to name the obtained decomposition e.g. "cholesky_cliquemergingIP".

Example:
```julia
data_path = "..\\data\\OPF_instances"
instances = ["case1354pegase.m"]
algo = "cholesky" #OR "MD" or "cholesky_real"
repo_name = "test_kmax2"
FUSION = "YES"
fusion_type = "our_merging_heuristic"
kmax=2
size_max_IPmerging = 0
nb_times = 0
write_file_decompositions(data_path, instances, algo, repo_name, FUSION, fusion_type, size_max_IPmerging, nb_times, kmax)
```

### To compute linear regression parameters
The file `linear_regression.jl` generates linear regression parameters from 10 clique decompositions.

### To solve an SDP problem
```julia
function solve_sdp(INSTANCE_NAME, FORMULATION, DATA_PATH)
```
The function `solve_sdp` solves the SDP problem for instance `INSTANCE_NAME` with clique decompositions specified in `FORMULATION`. The argument `DATA_PATH` points the repertory which contains OPF instances and clique decompositions.

Example:
```julia
INSTANCE_NAME = "case1354pegase"
FORMULATION = "our_merging_heuristic"
DATA_PATH = "..\\data"
solve_sdp(INSTANCE_NAME, FORMULATION, DATA_PATH)
```
